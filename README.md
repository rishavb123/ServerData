Videos {#videos .tab}
======

I created two videos to demo my project. I have a long version of the
video and a short one. The long version is around 11 and a half minutes
long and it covers almost all the features and touches a little bit on
how some parts of the code works. On the other hand, the shortened video
goes a lot faster and only covers the more unique features of the web
app. I also have the clips for each feature stored in the clips folder.

Full Video {#full-video .tab2}
----------

To access the Full Video open `Video/full.mp4`

Short Video {#short-video .tab2}
-----------

To access the Small Video open `Video/small.mp4`

Clips {#clips .tab2}
-----

Each clip describes a few features. The name of the file indicates the
feature that it talks about. The number in the name tells you what order
it shows up in the full video. To view these videos open `Video/clips`
and then choose the clip to watch.

Diagrams {#diagrams .tab}
========

These are a few images that I created during development to either map
out how something would look/work or it was to see how to do the math
for something.
